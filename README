Communication Contract: 

To request data from this microservice, the application must open text file run.txt with write access and enter 'run' into run.txt
An example call of this would be: 
with open(run.txt, 'w', encoding='utf-8) as file:
    file.write('run')
    file.close()

To receive data from this microservice, the application must open the text file workout.txt with read access. 
An example call of this would be:
with open(workout.txt, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    data = file.read()
    file.close()
